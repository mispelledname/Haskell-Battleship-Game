Purpose  : Test program for proj2 project to be used in Grok.

Based on hard coded target locations, receives tuple of guess and game state 
from guesser. Evaluates guess and prompts guesser for next guess. Game loop 
continues until guesser guesses target exactly.

-- | Main code to test Proj2 implementations within Grok. This will be run with
-- no command line arguments, so there's no way to specify the target to search
-- for. Therefore, I've hardwired one test, but students will need to do further
-- testing on their own.
